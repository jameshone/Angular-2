# Front End Test

This is a simple Angular 2 project that needs to be extended to support the following features

## User selection

A dropdown list with the users name would be enough for this project. Once the user is selected information should be
displayed (own component for that). How the user details is displayed its up to you.

## Data

The data for this project is inside the frontEnd/src/data folder, the data should be consumed from a service.

## What do we expect

We expect you to create the correct components, services, etc. to show your frontend skills. A nice layout showing off
your CSS skills it's also important. It is also important that you can bundle all components as well.

## Deliverables

Please create a branch of the project in GitHub and keep your commits in sync, avoid doing a commit all since we would like to see how incrementally its beind developed as well, make sure your comments are clear. Once you are confortable with the final result please issue a Pull Request.

## Further help

Run `npm install -g angular-cli@latest` to install angular-cli.
Run `npm install bootstrap` to add bootstrap if you want to use it.
Run `npm install` within the frontEnd folder to install all dependencies.
